ADDED REFERENCE TO PROJECT -ITS RIGHT

Got the below error when  its int Id , so converted it to string
        //Operation 'GetWCFRESTEmployee' in contract 'IWCFRESTEmployeeservice' has a path variable named 'Id' which does not have type 'string'.  Variables for UriTemplate path segments must have type 'string'

        //More idea https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/969ce363-4c0f-4642-b751-35e517336b0d/wcf-rest-variables-for-uritemplate-path-segments-must-have-type-string?forum=wcf
        //can invoke the service with int input parameter this way - http://localhost/WCFRESTReportingserviceEndpointsHostedIIS/WCFRESTReportingservice.svc/empbyid/?Id=7


    //        Currently, the type of variables for UriTemplate path segments is limited to type 'string'. For above sample, you can move id to query part:
    //[OperationContract]
    //        [WebGet(UriTemplate = "Entity/?id={id}")]
    //        Entity Find(Int32 id);

    //        [OperationContract]
    //        [WebGet(UriTemplate = "/Entity/?data={data}", RequestFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    //        String GetData(String data);

    //        This accepted a JSON String of: {"FirstName":"John","MiddleName":"H","LastName":"Doe"}
    //    the complete REST request was as follows:

    //http://localhost:8081/SampleRESTWebService/Service.svc/Entity/?data={"FirstName":"John","MiddleName":"H","LastName":"Doe"}
